//! Renetcode is a simple connection based client/server protocol agnostic to the transport layer,
//! was developed be used in games with UDP in mind. Implements the Netcode 1.02 standard, available
//! [here][standard] and the original implementation in C++ is available in the [netcode][netcode]
//! repository.
//!
//! Has the following feature:
//! - Encrypted and signed packets
//! - Secure client connection with connect tokens
//! - Connection based protocol
//!
//! and protects the game server from the following attacks:
//! - Zombie clients
//! - Man in the middle
//! - DDoS amplification
//! - Packet replay attacks
//!
//! [standard]: https://github.com/networkprotocol/netcode/blob/master/STANDARD.md
